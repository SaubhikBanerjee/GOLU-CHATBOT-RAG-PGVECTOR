# GOLU - The Best v1.0: Ultimate AI chatbot with PostgreSQL. 
## ![img.png](img.png)  Full Text Search and Semantic Search using PgVector and PostgreSQL
This is a real world project, I need to produce a prototype, where client can upload 
their documents (pdf, docx, ppt etc) and should be able to get answers from them.
The documents are very complex (mainly word docs) with tables and images. Your RAG will be as good as
your chunks. Tables are one of the challenges in RAG as LLMs can process plain text 
information easily. 
Database used in this project is PostgreSQL v14.11 with PgVector v0.6.0 and 
Python as programming language.
This is still ongoing and I will commit to this repository in my journey towards the completion.
